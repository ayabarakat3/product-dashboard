# React + Vite

In this challenge, I will create a Product Dashboard for a business using React and Vite. This dashboard will allow users to view a list of products, add new ones, and display product details. I will set up the environment with Vite, create components to organize the UI, and use JSX, keys, and props to pass data between components.
