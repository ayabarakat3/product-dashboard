# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


In this challenge, I will create a Product Dashboard for a business using React and Vite. This dashboard will allow users to view a list of products, add new ones, and display product details. I will set up the environment with Vite, create components to organize the UI, and use JSX, keys, and props to pass data between components.
